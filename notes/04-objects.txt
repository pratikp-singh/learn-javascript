* Objects:
    - Collection of key-value pairs
    - If properties that are highly related, we encapsulate inside an object.

* Factory Function:
    - naming convention for factory function: camel case
    - any function that returns a new object.
    - call the function with some parameters and it produces and returns a customized object
    - Useful when creating multiple objects that share the same structure and methods

    Example:
        function createCircle(radius){
            return {
                radius: radius,
                draw: function(){
                    console.log('draw');
                }
            }
        }

        - Since, the key and value are same, it is safe to write only radius.
        - Also, inside the object no need to write function.


        function createCircle(radius){
            return {
                radius,
                draw(){
                    console.log('draw');
                }
            }
        }

        let circle1 = createCircle(1);
        let circle2 = createCircle(10);

* Constructor Function:
    - A constructor function in JavaScript is a special function used as a blueprint to create and initialize multiple objects of the same type. It's a pattern for object creation that was common before ES6 classes were introduced.
    - The two key ingredients that make a function a constructor are:
        - The use of the this keyword to assign properties to the object being created.
        - Calling the function with the new operator to actually create the object.

    - By convention, the names of constructor functions start with a capital letter (e.g., Car, Person).

    - 'this' is reference to the object that is currently executing current code.
    - JS objects are dynamic. We can add properties after creation.

        function Circle(radius){
            this.radius = radius;
            this.draw = function(){
                console.log('Draw');
            }
        }

        let circle1 = new Circle(10);

    # How it works ?
        - When we call a function using the new operator, JS does the following in the background:
            * The new operator creates an empty JS object. (Like, const x = {};). 
            * It then sets the "this" keyword inside the function to point to that new empty object.
            * Executes the code inside the the constructor function, which adds properties and methods to the "this" object. (The properties and methods are added dynamically.)
            * Implicitly returns the newly created object (this).

                function Circle(radius) {
                this.radius = radius;
                this.draw = function () {
                    console.log("Draw");
                };
                }

                let c1 = new Circle(10);
                let c2 = new Circle(11);

                console.log(c1.radius);
                console.log(c2.radius);
        - If we do not use 'new' operator, then 'this' keyword inside the function will refer to global object which 'window' object in browser.

* Dynamic Nature of Objects:
    - Objects in JS are dynamic in nature. We can add new properties or delete the existing one.

        let newCircle = {
        radius: 1,
        };

        // Adding new properties and methods after creation
        newCircle.color = "yellow";
        newCircle["color"] = "red";
        newCircle.draw = function () {
        console.log("draw");
        };

        console.log(newCircle);

        // Deleting proeperties and methods dynamically
        delete newCircle.color;
        delete newCircle.draw;
        console.log(newCircle);

* Constructor Property:
    - Every object in JS has a property called 'constructor'.
    - It references the function that was used to create or construct create that object.

        function createCircle(radius) {
        return {
            radius,
            draw() {
            console.log("Draw");
            },
        };
        }

        function Circle(radius) {
        //   console.log(`this: ${this}`);

        this.radius = radius;
        this.draw = function () {
            console.log("Draw");
        };
        }


        let circle = createCircle(1); // returns Object() function
        let another = new Circle(1); // returns function Circle()

        console.log(circle.constructor);
        console.log(another.constructor);

    # createCircle(1).constructor returns Object(). This is because,  inside createCircle(), object created using object literal. This object literal is created using new Object() internally.

    So when we write 
        let x = {};
    it translates to 
        let x = new Object();

* Functions are Objects:
    - Functions are objects. They have one special ability: they can invoked or called.
    - Functions are first-class objects. A function can
        * Be assigned to a variable or stored in an array.
        * Be passed as an argument to another function.
        * Be returned from another function
        * Have properties and methods attached to it.

            function X(){}
            X.functionName = 'Function name is X';
            X.paramLength = 0;

        console.log(X.name); // name of the function
        console.log(X.length);
        console.log(Circle.constructor); // Function() 
    
    - When we declare a function using syntax, internally JS engine uses Function() constructor to create this object.

        Example:

            const X = new Function('value', `console.log('value is ', value)`);
            X(10); // We can call like any regular function.

            - Here the first argument to Function is the parameters to our function.
            - 2nd argument is the actual code for our function.

    - So, If a constructor function like Player is a blueprint for creating Player objects, then the built-in Function constructor is the master blueprint that JavaScript uses to create all functions, including the Player function itself.
    - Just as an object literal {} is created by the Object constructor and an array literal [] is created by the Array constructor, a function declaration or expression is created by the Function constructor behind the scenes.

    - When we write 
        let circle = new Circle(10);
      it translates to
        Circle.call({}, 10);

        Here, {} is the new object passed to call, which will be used inside Circle function definition.
        If we do not pass any object, by default 'window' will be passed, which will be modified in the Circle function definition.

* Value vs Reference Types:
    - Primitives are copied by their value.
        Example:
            let x = 10;
            let y = x;
            x = 20;
            console.log(y); // It still has 10;

    - Objects are copied by their reference.
        Example:
            let x = {value: 10};
            let y = x;
            x.value = 100;
            console.log(y); // same as x. As y has only reference.

    Example:
    --------

        // Value type vs reference type

        // Value Type

        let x = 10;
        let y = x;
        x = 12;
        console.log(y);

        let number = 10;

        function increase(number) {
        number += 1;
        }
        increase(number);
        console.log(number);

        // Reference Type

        let m = { value: 10 };
        let n = m;

        m.value += 1;
        console.log(n);

        let obj = { value: 10 };

        function increase(obj) {
        obj.value += 1;
        }
        increase(obj);
        console.log(obj);

* Adding or Removing Properties:
    - The objects in JS are dynamic. After creation, we can add or remove properties.

        Example:
            function Circle(radius){
                this.radius = radius;
                this.draw = function(){
                    console.log('draw');
                }
            }

            const circle = new Circle(10);
            
            // Add new property
            circle.location = {x: 1};

            circle['location'] = {x : 1};

            console.log(circle);

    - Bracket notation is useful when we do not know the property name. It comes dynamically. In this case, dot notation is not useful.

        Example:
        let property = 'location';
        circle[property] = {x: 1};

        Also, if the property name has special character, with dot notation it is not possible.

        circle['location-circle'] = {x: 1};

    - To delete any property, we can use delete keyword.

        Example: 
            delete circle['location']
            or 
            delete circle.location

* Enumerating Properties of an Object:

        // Enumearting objects:
        const circle = {
        radius: 1,
        draw() {
            console.log("draw");
        },
        };

        for (let key in circle) {
        console.log(`KEY: ${key}, VALUE: ${circle[key]}`);
        }

        // for...of can't be used with object as the object is not iterable

        for (const key of Object.keys(circle)) {
        console.log(key, circle[key]);
        }

        // Object.keys(): return only the array of keys
        // Object.entries(): return array of element and each element is an array of two elements: key and value
        for (let entry of Object.entries(circle)) {
        console.log(entry);
        }

        // To check if a property in an object: use 'in' operator
        if ("radius" in circle) console.log("Yes it has.");

* Cloning an Object:

    - Method 1: iterate over all the keys and copy to new object
    - Method 2: Using Object.assign() method
    - Method 3: Using spread operator

        Example:
        --------

            const circle = {
            radius: 1,
            draw() {
                console.log("draw");
            },
            };

            // Clone: Method 1 (Copy all key value pair)
            // const another = {};
            // for (let key in circle)
            //     another[key] = circle[key];

            // console.log(another);

            // Clone: Method 2 (Using Object.assign() method)

            // const another = Object.assign({}, circle); // first argument can be new object or existing object.
            // const another = Object.assign({
            //     color: 'yellow'
            // }, circle); // first argument can be new object or existing object.
            // console.log(another);


            // Clone: Method 3 (using spread operator)
            // const another = { ...circle };
            const another = { ...circle, color: 'yellow' };
            console.log(another);

* Garbage Collection:
    - In JS, we do not have to allocate and deallocate memory manually unlike C and C++.
    - JS engine has garbage collector. The job of Grabage Collector is to find the variable and constants that are no longer used and then deallocate the memory allocated to them earlier.
    - Memory allocation and deallocation happens behind the scene. We don't have the control over it.

* Math:

* String:

    // Primitive String
    let message = 'hi';
    console.log(typeof message); // string 


    // String Object
    const another  = new String('hi');
    console.log(typeof another); // object

##### Object Orietned Programming #####

* What is OOP
    - A programming paradigm centered around objects rather than functions.

    - 4 pillars:
        # Encapsulation:
            - Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (properties) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, usually a class. 
            - It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps protect the integrity of the data.

        # Abstraction:
            - Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.

            - Focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.

            - Helps reduce complexity by exposing only relevant methods and properties.

            - Achieved using abstract classes, interfaces, or by exposing only necessary methods.

        # Inheritance:
            - Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class (child or subclass) to acquire the properties and methods of another class (parent or superclass).

            - Promotes code reuse.
            
            - Enables hierarchical relationships.
            
            - The child class can add or override methods and properties

        # Polymorphism:
            - Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or property in different ways.

            - Means "many forms."
            
            - Allows methods to have different implementations based on the object calling them.
            
            - Achieved through method overriding or interfaces.

* Abstraction:
    - Hide the details and expose only the essentials
    - What if we want methods and properties that has to be used by methods of same objects, not outside.

* Private Properties and Methods:

    - In case of Constructor function, if we want some property or methods to be used by itself, instead of using this, we can declare them using let or const keyword. This is applicable to variable and functions also.

        Example:

            function Circle(radius) {
                this.radius = radius;
                let defaultLocation = { x: 0, y: 0 };

                let computeOptimumLocation = function () {};

                this.draw = function () {
                    defaultLocation.x = 10;
                    computeOptimumLocation();

                    console.log("draw");
                };
            }

    - This works because of closure. 
        # Closure: A closure in JavaScript is a feature where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables—even after the outer function has finished executing.

        Example:
            function createCounter() {
                let count = 0;  // This variable is in the outer function's scope

                function increment() {
                    count++;   // The inner function accesses and modifies 'count'
                    console.log(count);
                }

                return increment; // Returning the inner function, along with its closure over 'count'
            }

            const counter = createCounter();
            counter(); // Output: 1
            counter(); // Output: 2   
        - In this example, even though createCounter() has finished execution, the returned increment function still has access to the count variable. This retained access is a closure.

        - When you call createCounter(), JavaScript creates a new execution context for that function. Inside it, the count variable is created. Normally, after the function finishes, its local variables would be removed from memory.

        - However, because the inner increment function (which is returned) references count, JavaScript keeps count alive in memory as part of the closure. This means:

        - The function definition of createCounter is always in memory (like any function).
        The execution context (local variables) of createCounter is usually destroyed after it runs.
        - But: If an inner function (like increment) is returned and still references those variables, JavaScript keeps those variables (like count) in memory as long as the returned function exists.

        - In summary:
            - The count variable stays in memory because the returned increment function forms a closure over it. The closure preserves the environment (variables) it needs, even after createCounter() has finished executing.

        - In short, while scope is about where variables live and can be accessed, a closure is a pattern that lets a function continue to access its original scope even after that scope has finished execution.

    - But, technically this is not private properties as they are not part of circle object. They are just local variable.

* Getters and Setters:

    * Method 1: (Define a function that returns the value)

            function Circle(radius) {
            this.radius = radius;
            let defaultLocation = { x: 0, y: 0 };

            let computeOptimumLocation = function () {};

            this.getDefaultLocation = function () {
                return defaultLocation;
            };

            this.draw = function () {
                defaultLocation.x = 10;
                computeOptimumLocation();

                console.log("draw");
            };
            }

            const circle = new Circle(10);
            circle.getDefaultLocation();

        - But, we are calling getDefaultLocation as a function.
    
    * Method 2: (Use Object.defineProperty() or Object.defineProperties() method)
        - 
            Example:
                function Circle(radius) {
                this.radius = radius;
                let defaultLocation = { x: 0, y: 0 };

                let computeOptimumLocation = function () {};

                this.draw = function () {
                    defaultLocation.x = 10;
                    computeOptimumLocation();

                    console.log("draw");
                };

                Object.defineProperty(this, "defaultLocation", {
                    get: function () {
                    return defaultLocation;
                    },
                    set: function (value) {
                    if (!value.x || !value.y) throw new Error("Invalid location.");

                    defaultLocation = value;
                    },
                });
                }

                const circle = new Circle(10);
                console.log(circle.defaultLocation);

* EXERCISE - Stopwatch

        function StopWatch() {
        let startTime,
            endTime,
            running,
            duration = 0;

        this.start = function () {
            if (running) throw new Error("Stopwatch has already started.");

            running = true;

            startTime = new Date();
        };

        this.stop = function () {
            if (!running) throw new Error("Stopwatch is not started.");

            running = false;

            endTime = new Date();

            const seconds = (endTime.getTime() - startTime.getTime()) / 1000;

            duration += seconds;
        };

        this.reset = function () {
            startTime = null;
            endTime = null;
            running = false;
            duration = 0;
        };

        Object.defineProperty(this, "duration", {
            get: function () {
            return duration;
            },
        });
        }
