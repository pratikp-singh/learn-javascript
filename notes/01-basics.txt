* Variables:
    - Can't be reserved keyword
    - Should be meaningful
    - Can't start with number (1name)
    - Can't contain a space or hyphen (-)
    - Are case sensitive
    - Should be declared using let or constant keyword. 
    - var should not be used.

* Constants:
    - The value of a constant can't change.
        const interestRate = 7.8;
        interestRate = 8; // Error

* Primitive Types (Value Types):
    - In JS, there are two types: Primitive and Reference Types.

    - Primitive Types:
        * String
        * Number
        * Boolean
        * undefined
        * null
        * Symbol

    - undefined and null are both the values of variable.
    - The type of undefined is undefined.
    - The type of null is object.
    - So, undefined is both type and value.

* Dynamic Typing:
    - Two type of languages: Statically Typed and Dynamically Typed

    - Static Type:
        - The type of the variable can't change after declaration.

    - Dynamic Type:
        - The type of variable can change in future.

    - Operator typeof can be used to check the type of the variable.

* Object Types:
    - In object types, we have:
        * objects
        * arrays
        * functions

* Objects:
    - 

*  Arrays:
    - List of items or elements

* Functions:
    - Two types of function: performs a task or calculate something
